## Why Previous Models Were Placeholders

- I don't have access to download files
- I can't store actual STL files
- I was showing you the STRUCTURE, not real data
- Now you have REAL sources to get REAL files

## Making It Work

The code is READY for real STL files:
- ✅ STL loader is configured
- ✅ Paths are set up
- ✅ Viewer will load them
- ❌ You just need to download the actual files

## Quick Test

1. Download ONE model (Cybertruck is easiest)
2. Put in `public/models/tesla-cybertruck.stl`
3. Refresh your site
4. Click on Tesla Cybertruck in catalog
5. You'll see the REAL 3D model!

## Common Issues

**"Still showing a box/generic car"**
- The STL file isn't in the right place
- Check: `public/models/` folder exists
- File name must match exactly

**"Model doesn't load"**
- STL might be too large (>50MB)
- Try a simpler model first
- Check browser console for errors
